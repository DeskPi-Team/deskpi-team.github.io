## Power Supply Issues
### The included wall charger is not working properly, if it's attached, the power button keeps flashing in red and the device can't be switched on. (Other power adapters (e.g. the official power supply) are working fine.) 

* At the first time,the power button keeps flashing in red, please unplug the power charger and then plug it again, wait for a few seconds, and if the power button still keeps flashing in red, please contact our sales man.
* The output voltage of our power supply to DeskPi is `12V`, and the voltage provided by DeskPi to the Raspberry Pi is `5V`. The general power supply cannot provide a suitable voltage.
